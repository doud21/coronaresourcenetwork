# The Corona Resource Network: An open-source hub for coronavirus resources

Part of the Emergency Design Collective, this resource website is part of a human-centered design project on mask accessibility and distribution. Users may input their zip code for locations to obtain testing and masks, with data being pulled from an open-contribution, constantly updated Google Sheets database. Users may also find on the site free flyers and posters for distribution around neighborhoods in order to show mask solidarity.
